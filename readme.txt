http://www.powerbot.org/community/topic/717653-neilpatricks-galtar-lighter/

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SETUP:
    1-Demon Butler and Marble Incense Burners ONLY! (Will add GUI in 1.02 which should be out estimated: 6/30-7/1
    2-Noted Marrentills: I keep around 10k in inventory in the first spot ( can be any spot ). It uses roughly 60 herbs/hour.
    3-Have at least 100k in money pouch to pay the butler, (the Demon butlers cost per herb is 48 coins.)
    4-If you have a bank PIN open the withdraw from money pouch and enter the pin before you start script so you can pay the butler.
    5-Click Butler and have him follow you into your Altar room.
    6-Start in the altar room with camera able to see both of the burners. ( it will adjust if it can't see the burner but it makes it easier if it can see both from the start)
    7-Start Script

Profit/Hour Estimate:
    -100,000- 1,000,000. There is a risk of no donations, but also the reward of 1M+ donations. 
    -I've personally made 30m in 1 week with this script, sometimes making up to 6m+ per day (10 hours per day).

Features:
    -Lights the incense burners.
    -Simple paint
    -Completely AFK for 6 Hours. (Gui timer helps to keep track of when 6 hours is almost up)
    -Does NOT auto accept trades (Premium feature only.)
    -Can use a different players house ( but will not stop script if you run out of herbs I do not suggest unless you go back every 20 minutes and get more herbs from bank! Will try to add soon an auto turn off option, Banking will be Premium Only!)
    Random mouse movement - anti-ban.

Change log:
    -1.00 Initial Beta 6/10/2012
    -1.01 Added Paint + Fixed Bugs - 6/22/2012
